sgpm - Simple Go Prometheus Middleware

Based on [github.com/slok/go-prometheus-middleware](https://github.com/slok/go-prometheus-middleware) but simpler, without any support for specific go framework.

The [`example` directory](https://github.com/amopromo/simple-go-prometheus-middleware/tree/master/example) contains simple examples on how to use this package.
